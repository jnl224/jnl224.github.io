# About Me
My name is Jenn Lindley and I am a sophmore journalism major at Lehigh University. I am using this page to host my data journalism projects.
I am very intersted in working for the entertainment industry, whether that be in Broadway or in TV/film. For most of my life, I have been very fascinated by this industry and want to have an insider look. Journalism can provide me with the tools to reach my goal as it helps me master my communication skills. I have loved learning all about the different sides of journalism from reporting to editing to visual communication and now data journalism and am excited to see my next steps.

# What Percentage of First-Years are Enrolled in Each College?
In 2019, Lehigh University recorded data about the student body using information about how many students are enrolled as undergradutes vs graduates and information about the first-year class. I chose to focus on the data of the first-year class, looking at how many students are enrolled in each college. From the data it is clear that majority of students are enrolled in the College of Arts & Sciences. I gathered this data from looking at the 2019 report conducted by the Office of Institutional Research & Strategic Analytics.

# Which Teams Have The Highest Percentage to Win the UEFA Championship League
 This information came from FiveThirtyEight which has many different places where they gather data about the predictions of different sports teams. Since my family is very into soccer, I choose to look at the predicted percentages of different club teams and their probability to win the UEFA Champion League. My method to find this data was to look at different sites that predict sports and pick the best data set. This data implies the percentage of each team winning, and the data set also includes the percentage of them making semis and making finals.

# Life Satisfaction in Cantril Ladder
The scatter plot I chose demonstrated the self-reported life satisfaction vs GDP per capita in 2017 of 17 different countries. The highest level of life satisfaction was in Finland, with their GDP per capita being towards the middle/highest compared to the other countries. The lowest level of life satisfaction was in India, with their GDP per capita being a bit higher than Finland. The graph does not show each country and their corresponding GDP per capita and life satisfaction, but using the data set I was provided with, I came to these conclusions.

# Median Age vs Births Per Women
Our World in Data provides a variety of charts that demonstrate the relationships between many different things. I choose to focus on age structure, specifically the comparison between the median age of women in different countries and the amount of births per women in each country. Out of the ten countries I chose to focus on, the oldest median age was in Italy and the youngest median age was in Bangledesh. The country with the highest amount of births per woman was Malaysia, with a statistic of 1.97. The data set I focused on was from 2020, but this chart and visual can take you through many different years.

# Top 20 Most Bike Friendly Cities 2019
In 2019, Wired ranked the top 20 most bike-friendly cities in the entire world. These cities ranged across the country including cities in Europe, Japan, the United States and more. The article included some criticism for each city they included as well as the benefits, or the reason why the city was included in this list.

# Top 10 Most Populated Cities in the World 2022
Although this may seem like a boring topic, I was extremely curious by what city actually would be ranked number one. Before researching, I was under the impression that a city in China would be at number one, but I was wrong as it doesn't even reach the top first or second most populated city. However, two cities in China are in the top ten, as well as other cities that I did not expect including Cairo, Egypt, and Dhaka, Bangladesh. When I researched more about each city, I realized why they were so populated and found out more information than I had anticipated.

# Where Do Lehigh Students Party?
Lehigh students conducted a survey based on where students on campus preferred to party. Some students preffered off campus and some preffered staying on the hill and attending parties at the Greek houses. This data visualization shows the difference between both males and females and their preference of where they would like to party.

# Higher Education Data 2013
In 2013, data was released by Data.gov that includes a variety of information about higher education institutions. The data set has over 1,000 different schools and includes different features about them, including the zipcode, longitutide and latitude, and county. Besides location features, the data set also provides information about the college, and I choose to feature a few different parts in my visualization. My first page includes the admissions total at each college highlighted on the map and the highest degree offered. When looking at the map, the viewer can pick to view the public institutions and the private institutions. The second page includes the number of first-time undergreaduate international students as well as highlights which institutions in the United States are historically black.
