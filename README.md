# About Me
My name is Jenn Lindley and I am a sophmore journalism major at Lehigh University. I am using this page to host my data journalism projects.
I am very intersted in working for the entertainment industry, whether that be in Broadway or in TV/film. For most of my life, I have been very fascinated by this industry and want to have an insider look. Journalism can provide me with the tools to reach my goal as it helps me master my communication skills. I have loved learning all about the different sides of journalism from reporting to editing to visual communication and now data journalism and am excited to see my next steps.
